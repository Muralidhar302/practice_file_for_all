 what is gitfetch
 The Git Fetch command is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
 It doesnâ€™t make any changes to the current working directory. 
 It stores all the changes in a separate branch called the remote-tracking branch.
 git merge or git rebase command is used to merge these changes into our current working directory.
